## 0.0.4 - 2022-31-12

Using native PHP templates.

## 0.0.3 - 2022-29-12

Add PHP for the basic MVC that will provide routing.

I want the website to be usable without JavaScript. I need SSR for that and I'm
comfy with PHP. Maybe in the future I switch to other alternative (faster and
probably compiled, Go V.S. Rust).

I'm using an [MVC base](https://github.com/torres-developer/MVCBase) that I
created because I knew I'll probably would need to use it.

Also I created a script that auto initiates a http server on the port 8000
using your local IP address.

## 0.0.2 - 2022-21-12

Testing server in Go.

Basic teterinos generation in TypeScript.

## 0.0.1 - 2022-20-12

Some basic HTML and CSS. Creating an visual idea of what it will look like.
