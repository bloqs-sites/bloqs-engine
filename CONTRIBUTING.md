# I don't know if you can.

You even made the source code public and free. What do you mean you don't know?

I would like help, obviously. But this is a PAP.

# What's a PAP

The thing is that, this project is for my *``Prova de AptidÃ£o Profissional''*
or **PAP**. We students need do the PAP on the senior-year so that the teachers
can access the knowledge and skills acquired by us throughout the 3 years of
training.

It's mandatory to do the PAP, I mean, you can opt to don't do it but until you
make the PAP, and it is evaluated, you won't get the diploma that you finished
twelfth grade.

The PAP regulation says (translated):
> ``The PAP takes the form of a personal project, subject to discussion and
> opinion research among colleagues from the same disciplinary area or not,
> with each trainee competing to conceive, carry out and evaluate it, under the
> guidance and monitoring of a or more teachers.''

# TL;DR

I think you can help me but not doing the job for me.

If you would like to help, give me tips, ideas, correct me on things I did
wrong, share resources that might help me, give me feedback, etc.

Not just because I think you can't do the job for me but because I also want to
improve my skills and if you do something for me or correct a bug I won't learn
with my errors.

Thank you either way <3
